Here it is — a clean, authoritative **`/docs/rituals/README.md`** that sets the tone for the entire rituals directory. It frames your repo as a living operator manual and gives every future ritual a place to belong.

You can drop this in as‑is.

# **Operator Rituals**  
### *The Living Manual of How This System Is Built, Repaired, and Evolved*

This directory contains the **operator rituals** that guide the construction, maintenance, and evolution of the system. These rituals are not metaphors or motivational quotes — they are *practical, repeatable procedures* that shape how the operator engages with the codebase.

Each ritual captures a specific mode of work: debugging, feature creation, restoration, refactoring, or system‑level control. They exist to reduce friction, preserve clarity, and reinforce the operator’s role as the builder of a larger structure.

Rituals are added as the system grows. They are meant to be invoked, not merely read.

## **Philosophy**

A system is more than code.  
It is a rhythm, a set of behaviors, a way of thinking.

Rituals:

- Anchor the operator during difficult or chaotic moments  
- Provide language for persistence and restoration  
- Turn repeated actions into intentional practices  
- Preserve the culture of the project as it evolves  
- Create a shared mythology for future collaborators  

Every ritual is a brick in the cathedral.

More rituals will be added as new workflows emerge.

## **How to Add a New Ritual**

1. Create a new Markdown file in this directory.  
2. Use a clear, mythic name that reflects the ritual’s purpose.  
3. Include:
   - Purpose  
   - Invocation phrase  
   - When to use it  
   - Steps  
   - Philosophy  
4. Link it here under **Current Rituals**.

Rituals should be concise, powerful, and directly tied to real operator behavior.

If you want, I can help you craft a second ritual — maybe one for feature creation, one for refactoring, or one for system‑level control.
