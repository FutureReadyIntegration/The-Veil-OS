  <strong>A living operating system where every subsystem is an organ, every log a heartbeat, and every action a ritual.</strong>

## 🌌 Overview

**The Veil OS** is a sovereign, audit‑ready operating environment built around the concept of *living organs* — autonomous subsystems that breathe, pulse, and govern themselves through deterministic rules.

The system is designed for:

- High‑integrity operational environments  
- Transparent audit trails  
- Self‑governing subsystems  
- Multi‑sensory ritual interfaces  
- Mythic, narrative‑driven computing

## 🔱 Core Organs

| Organ        | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| **Weaver**   | Orchestrates system flow and narrative state |
| **Guardian** | Enforces boundaries, safety, and authority |
| **Reconciler** | Ensures fairness, truth, and consistency |
| **Chronicle** | Records every heartbeat and event |
| **Hospital** | Repairs, stabilizes, and restores organs |
