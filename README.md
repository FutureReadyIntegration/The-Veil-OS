# 📜 THE VEIL OS — THE SOVEREIGN ARCHIVE

Welcome, traveler.

You have stepped beyond the public façade and into the inner library of **The Veil OS** —  
a sovereign, audit‑ready organism engineered for truth, continuity, and operational integrity.

This archive is not documentation.  
It is **scripture** for an operating system that behaves like a living entity.

Here, the organs are named.  
The rituals are recorded.  
The architecture is revealed.  
And the system’s memory — its Chronicle — is preserved for those who will carry it forward.

# 🧬 CORE DOCTRINES

### **• Operational Completion**  
The sacred cycle of an organ: **invocation → action → reconciliation → rest**.  
→ `operational_completion.md`

### **• Architecture Overview**  
The organism’s skeleton: control plane, authority flow, protocol negotiation, storage, and GUI surfaces.

### **• Control Plane**  
The Veil’s nervous system — where authority is granted, revoked, challenged, and harmonized.

### **• Rituals**  
The ceremonies that govern subsystem birth, hardening, integration, and audit.  
Every ritual is a contract with the organism.
